# Info

SimpleTodo is, as the name implies, a simple todo app made for educational purposes. It is my first project made using t3stack.

# First commit

The app in the beginning wasn't meant to be developed further. That resulted in the first commit being named "added all app functionality", instead of currently correct "added basic app functionality".
